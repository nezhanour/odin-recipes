Hello! My name is Nezha

At present, I am learning Web development with the Odin project.  

On this project, I apply everything I've learned,Sometimes the site turns out to be awesome sometimes it turns out to be a disaster.Isn't that the concept of learning.

The main point is to just have fun creating stuff.
