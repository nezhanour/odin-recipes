Hello! My name is Nezha

At present, I am learning Web development with the Odin project.  

On this project, I apply everything I've learned,Sometimes the site turns out to be awesome sometimes it turns out to be a disaster.Isn't that the concept of learning, the journey to get to that goal.  

The main point is to just have fun creating stuff.  


Currently working on the "You may like this as well" section.
