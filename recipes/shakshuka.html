        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Shakshuka is a very common dish in North Africa and Middle East and is originally from a country that has had a persistent passion for eggs and tomatoes. Tunisia.</p>
        <p>The Moroccan version of the shakshuka includes kefta meatballs and in Morocco we don’t call it shakshuka but simply "kefta and egg tagine"</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>450 gr kefta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 can peeled tomatoes (400gr/14 oz.) or 5 ripe tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
            <li>pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh coriander for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Shape the kefta into small meatballs (2,5 cm diameter), cover and reserve in the fridge.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan (or deep skillet) stir in the rest of the ingredients, except the eggs, over medium heat. Bring to the boil and cover with a lid under low heat. Let simmer until it becomes a thick sauce, about 25min.</li>
