        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>cBriouate or briwate is a puff pastry , usually triangular or cylindrical in shape, typical of Morocco. It can be sweet or salty.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, these babies are fried, as you know, I always try to avoid frying foods when I can. Because, like the majority of us, I wasn’t born with the genes that allow you to eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and still fit in my jeans and also because I was told that fried foods are bad for our hearts. As a result, we are not frying them, we are baking them and they taste so good and fluffy you won’t make the difference. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>450 gr prepared kefta</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, and more for serving</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>200 gr filo pastry</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon icing sugar</li>
            <li>A handful of roughly chopped mint leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180 C (350 F). Warm up a large pan over medium heat and add in ½ tablespoon of butter and leave until melted. Transfer in the kefta and the cinnamon and cook until the meat is brown, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon. About 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked kefta in a large bowl. If you notice some liquid, drain the kefta of any excess water to prevent the filling from becoming wet.</li>
            <li>n the same pan, add in ½ tablespoon of butter over medium heat and leave until melted. Beat the eggs and transfer them in the pan. Use a wooden spoon to gently stir the eggs until scrambled and fully cooked. Stir the scrambled eggs in the large bowl and mix with the kefta. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Melt the remaining butter in a pan or in the microwave. Unroll the filo and cut the pastry length ways into 10 cm large and 30 cm long rectangles. Use a sharp knife to cut the pastry and keep the filo rectangles covered with a damp towel until ready to use to prevent from drying out.</li>
            <li>On a work surface, place a filo rectangle and brush it with melted butter. Top the corner of the rectangle with 3 tablespoons of kefta and egg mixture and fold to form a triangle, up to the right and left, until a triangle is formed. Repeat until you’ve exhausted all the kefta and egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Transfer the triangles on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush with egg yolk and place in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes until golden.</li>
            <li>Serve warm over a bed of chopped mint leaves and a very generous sprinkling of icing sugar and ground cinnamon</li>
        </ol>
